# PortfolioSite
Sample portfolio site using Bootstrap 4

This site is created using prompts from a Software Guild Intro to 
Web Development course.

I started out with a simple index page and have started adding HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript
Additionally, I am using my Bootstrap skills to format buttons and adding a carousel of images
using Bootstrap

I also added a favicon to my index page
